text="""A vaccine for the coronavirus will likely be ready by early 2021 but rolling it out safely across India’s 
    1.3 billion people will be the country’s biggest challenge in fighting its surging epidemic, a leading vaccine 
    scientist told Bloomberg.India, which is host to some of the front-runner vaccine clinical trials, currently has 
    no local infrastructure in place to go beyond immunizing babies and pregnant women, said Gagandeep Kang, professor
    of microbiology at the Vellore-based Christian Medical College and a member of the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee 
    on Vaccine Safety.The timing of the vaccine is a contentious subject around the world. In the U.S.,
    President Donald Trump has contradicted a top administration health expert by saying a vaccine would be available
    by October. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had promised an indigenous vaccine as early 
    as mid-August, a claim the government and its apex medical research body has since walked back.
